Noita Data
==========

Stuff for reading and making sense of Noita's data files, scripts, etc.

Unpack your `data.wak` and put it in a `data/` folder.
You will also need to copy over `data/translations/` as well.

The `shims` folder contains a few mock implementations of Noita game engine functions,
as well as some actual reimplementations (in Lua of course) where possible.
